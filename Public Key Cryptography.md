# Public Key Cryptography: RSA Keys

Undoubtedly, each of us has created an RSA key pair at least once in our lives, for example, to connect to GitHub without entering a password each time. Usually, the entire process takes a couple of minutes â€” just follow a simple instruction.

But what exactly happens when you generate these keys?

Do you know what is contained in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file? Why does SSH create two files, both in different formats? Have you noticed that one file starts with the characters "ssh-rsa," and the other starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`? Have you paid attention to the fact that sometimes the header of the second file says "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" instead of "RSA"?

I believe every developer should have at least a minimal understanding of the various formats of RSA keys. This becomes even more important if you want to pursue a career in infrastructure management.

## RSA Algorithm

Since the invention of public-key cryptography, various key pair generation systems have been devised. One of the first is RSA, created by three brilliant cryptographers and dating back to 1977. The history of RSA is interesting in that the scheme was initially invented by English mathematician Clifford Cox. However, he was required to keep it secret at the request of the British intelligence, for which he worked.

It's worth noting that RSA is not synonymous with public-key cryptography; it's just one of the possible implementations. RSA, still more than 40 years after its publication, remains one of the most common algorithms. In particular, it is the standard algorithm used for generating SSH key pairs. Given that today every developer has their public key added to GitHub, BitBucket, and similar systems, it can be confidently said that RSA is quite widely used.

In this article, I won't delve into the internal workings of the RSA algorithm. If you're interested in the details of this algorithm, its mathematical foundation, you can find plenty of sources both on the Internet and in textbooks. The theory behind RSA is far from trivial, but it's definitely worth spending time on if you want to seriously delve into the mathematical aspect of cryptography.

In this article, I will explore two methods of creating RSA key pairs and the formats for storing them. Applied cryptography, like many other topics in computer science, is constantly evolving, and tools often change. Finding out how to perform a specific action is usually not difficult (thanks to StackOverflow), but what can be challenging is getting a clear understanding of what is happening behind the scenes.

In all the examples provided in this article, a 2048-bit RSA key is used, created specifically for this purpose. Therefore, all symbols you see are taken from a real example. After writing the article, this key was destroyed.

## PEM Format

Let's start the conversation about key pairs with the format of their storage. Currently, the most common storage format is PEM (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail). As the name suggests, this format was originally created for encrypting email but later became a general format for storing cryptographic data such as keys and certificates. It is described in RFC 7468 ("Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures").

An example of a private key in PEM format looks like this:

```

-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

In principle, dealing with the PEM format can be inferred from the standard headers and footers that identify the content. The presence of dashes and the two words `BEGIN` and `END` is consistent, while the part `PRIVATE KEY` changes depending on the content, including cases where the PEM file contains something other than a key, such as an X.509 certificate for SSL.

The PEM format specifies that the content body (the part between the header and footer) is encoded using Base64.

If the private key was encrypted with a password, the header and footer would differ.

```

-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

When using the PEM format to store cryptographic keys, the content body follows a format called PKCS #8. Initially, this standard was created by a private company (RSA Laboratories) but later became a de facto standard and was described in various RFCs, including RFC 5208 ("Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2").

To describe the structure of the data, the PKCS #8 format uses the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) language, while DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) is used to serialize this structure into binary format. This means that Base64 decoding of the content will result in some binary value that can only be processed by an ASN.1 parser.

Let's summarize the above information in the form of a diagram:

```
-----BEGIN label-----
+--------------------------- Base64 ---------------------------+
|                                                              |
| PKCS #8 content:                                             |
| ASN.1 language serialised with DER                           |
|                                                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
-----END label-----
```
Please note that due to the peculiarities of the ASN.1 structure, the bodies of PEM-formatted keys always start with the same characters: `MIG` for 1024-bit keys, and `MII` for 2048 and 4096-bit keys.
